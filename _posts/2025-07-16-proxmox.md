Why I Chose Proxmox for My Home Lab? A few years ago, I picked up three old HP ProLiant servers on eBay. I didn't have a clear purpose for it at the time, but I knew I'd eventually use it to sharpen my cybersecurity skills.

When I finally decided to build a dedicated home lab, I chose Proxmox VE as the hypervisor for a few reasons:
- It is a complete open-source platform for enterprise virtualization
- Bare-Metal Friendly. No Extra OS Required
- Opportunity to Learn Something New

I had experience with VirtualBox and VMware, but Proxmox was unfamiliar territory. It gave me a chance to explore enterprise-grade virtualization tools hands-on.

To set up my lab, I followed a great step-by-step guide from <a href="https://benheater.com/proxmox-laptop-cybersecurity-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Heater's blog</a> that explains how to deploy a home lab on Proxmox, making it an excellent resource for beginners. At this post, I'd like to put my notes in a more compact way since I haven't deployed the lab exactly the same way as Ben.

## **Prerequisites**
<br>
***Proxmox .iso file*** 
<a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/proxmox-virtual-environment/iso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/proxmox-virtual-environment/iso</a><br>

***Ventoy USB*** <br>
It allows booting multiple ISOs without needing to rewrite the drive. (!!! In my situation with ProLink, *Rufus* and *BalenaEtcher* didn't work)

<br>

***Hardware***

```bash
system         ProLiant DL360p Gen8 (763479-B21)
processor      Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 0 @ 2.50GHz
memory         64 GiB 
storage        1.4 TB, 4-Port SATA IDE Controller
```

<br><br>

## **Installation**

<br>
**Install Proxmox VE on an HP server from ISO (Ventoy USB).**

Installing Proxmox is pretty straightforward, and the official documentation <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Installation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Installation</a> has a good explanation walking you through it, especially when it comes to choosing partition sizes and file systems specifically for your system and needs. Additionally, you can join the <a href="https://forum.proxmox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proxmox community</a> that offers help and support for Proxmox VE.

After the installation process, we need to configure our Proxmox environment. You can use a shell in the web browser console ([https://proxmox-ip-address:8006](https://proxmox-ip-address:8006/)) or connect to Proxmox via SSH using, like in my case, <a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MobaXterm</a>, which provides a comprehensive toolkit for remote connection. For logging in, the username is `root`, and the password is whatever you set during the installation.

## Disable subscription banner

First, we are going to remove a pop-up banner permanently that appears in the web console after login, which informs users about the lack of a valid subscription.

*Pop-up banner for non-subscribed users*

```bash
# Create a backup of the proxmoxlib.js

cd /usr/share/javascript/proxmox-widget-toolkit/ 
cp proxmoxlib.js proxmoxlib.js.bak
```
<br><br>

### Edit the proxmoxlib.js in the nano editor:

<br>
-  Press *****Ctrl+W* and search for the line that contains *"no valid sub"*

<br>
-  Delete the block of highlighted lines

<br>
-  Save the file and exit
-  Restart Proxmox proxy service

```bash
systemctl restart pveproxy.service
```

## Configuration and Updates

### Comment Out Enterprise Repositories:

```bash
sed '/^[^#]/ s/^/# /' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
sed '/^[^#]/ s/^/# /' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
```

### Add Proxmox Community (No-Subscription) Repositories:

```bash
echo -e '\n# Proxmox community package repository' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve $(grep CODENAME /etc/os-release | cut -d '=' -f 2) pve-no-subscription" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
```

*Updated ***sources.list*** file*

![Updated ***sources.list*** file]({{ "/assets/images/image%206.png" | relative_url }})


### **DNS Configuration**

Edit `/etc/resolv.conf`:

```
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
```

### **Install Dependencies**

```bash
apt clean && apt update
apt install ifupdown2 openvswitch-switch -y
```

> `ifupdown2` is required for better network bridge management in Proxmox
> 
> 
> `openvswitch-switch` is useful for more advanced virtual networking (e.g. isolated labs)
> 

### **Upgrade and Reboot System**

```bash
pveupgrade
reboot
```
