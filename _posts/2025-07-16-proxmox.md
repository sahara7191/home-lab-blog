Why I Chose Proxmox for My Home Lab? A few years ago, I picked up two old HP ProLiant servers on eBay. I didn't have a clear purpose for it at the time, but I knew I'd eventually use it to sharpen my cybersecurity skills.

When I finally decided to build a dedicated home lab, I chose Proxmox VE as the hypervisor for a few reasons:
- It is a complete open-source platform for enterprise virtualization
- Bare-Metal Friendly. No Extra OS Required
- Opportunity to Learn Something New

I had experience with VirtualBox and VMware, but Proxmox was unfamiliar territory. It gave me a chance to explore enterprise-grade virtualization tools hands-on.

To set up my lab, I followed a great step-by-step guide from <a href="https://benheater.com/proxmox-laptop-cybersecurity-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Heater's blog</a> that explains how to deploy a home lab on Proxmox, making it an excellent resource for beginners.

# **Prerequisites**

***Proxmox .iso file***

***Ventoy USB*** <br>
It allows booting multiple ISOs without needing to rewrite the drive. (!!! In my situation with ProLink, *Rufus* and *BalenaEtcher* didn't work)
