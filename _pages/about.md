This blog documents my learning path and practicing in the cybersecurity home lab, a space where I experiment with detection engineering, pentesting, threat hunting, and digital forensics. 

Everything I publish here is based on my hands-on experience: configuring tools like Wazuh, pfSense, and Velociraptor; simulating real-world attacks in Active Directory environments; and applying frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK in lab-scale scenarios.

Whether Iâ€™m tuning alert rules, analyzing event logs, or breaking something on purpose to figure out how it works, I treat this space as a way to stay sharp, build repeatable processes, and showcase practical skills.

This blog also serves as a living reference for the configurations, decisions, and issues Iâ€™ve worked through.

## Who I Am

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and graduate student pursuing an M.S. in Digital Forensics and Cyber Investigation. This blog is my space to document hands-on experience in threat hunting, pentesting, digital forensics, and security operations using a custom-built home lab.

My technical interests include:

- SIEM and log analysis (Wazuh, Sysmon)
- Incident response and endpoint forensics (Velociraptor, DFIR workflows)
- Red/purple team methodologies (Kali Purple, BloodHound, simulated adversaries)
- Secure lab infrastructure and automation (Proxmox, pfSense, Python)

Iâ€™ve built this lab to closely mimic enterprise conditions â€” including multiple VLANs, domain controllers, and monitored endpoints â€” so I can test and learn in a controlled but realistic environment.
