## About This Blog

This blog documents my cybersecurity home lab â€” a space where I experiment with detection engineering, threat hunting, and digital forensics. Itâ€™s part technical journal, part portfolio.

Everything I publish here is based on hands-on experience: configuring tools like Wazuh, pfSense, and Velociraptor; simulating real-world attacks in Active Directory environments; and applying frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK in lab-scale scenarios.

Whether Iâ€™m tuning alert rules, analyzing event logs, or breaking something on purpose to figure out how it works â€” I treat this space as a way to stay sharp, build repeatable processes, and showcase practical skills.

## Who I Am

I'm currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Digital Forensics and Cyber Investigation, and hold a background in cybersecurity fundamentals, pentesting, and lab development.

My technical interests include:

- SIEM and log analysis (Wazuh, Sysmon)
- Incident response and endpoint forensics (Velociraptor, DFIR workflows)
- Red/purple team methodologies (Kali Purple, BloodHound, simulated adversaries)
- Secure lab infrastructure and automation (Proxmox, pfSense, Python)

Iâ€™ve built this lab to closely mimic enterprise conditions â€” including multiple VLANs, domain controllers, and monitored endpoints â€” so I can test and learn in a controlled but realistic environment.

## Why I Built This

- To **document and reflect** on hands-on technical growth  
- To **demonstrate capability** in real-world tool usage during interviews  
- To **contribute back** to the community through shareable configs, walkthroughs, and fixes

This blog also serves as a living reference for the configurations, decisions, and issues Iâ€™ve worked through â€” all the stuff that never fits on a resume but makes you better at the job.
